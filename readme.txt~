Plug-in Codex Generator generates documention for your plug-in based on in-source documentation.

== Description ==

Creating page of function reference in Codex involves looking up information about function and dealing with complicated wiki markup.

This plugin automates much of the process by reading function's inline documentation and converting to wiki markup:

* short and long function descriptions
* parameters and their default values
* version of WordPress function was added in
* source file that contains a function

You can also navigate, search, sort and filter functions by much of that information in plugin's interface.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-codex-generator` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress

Note that this plugin **won't work properly with opcode caching enabled**. Opcode caching mechanisms (such as APC or eAccelerator) discard PHPDoc data and make it unavailable to plugin.
